# üêÑ Animal Disease Prediction Application

Welcome to the **Animal Disease Prediction Application**! This Django-based web application assists farmers and pet owners in predicting diseases in cows,dogs,cats and goats based on symptoms and uploaded images. It features advanced machine learning models, including a Voting Classifier for cows and a CNN model for dog skin diseases, as well as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model that provides answers based on a specified PDF document which is loaded to the llm model using vector embeddings.

## üìã Features

### Cow Disease Prediction
- **Symptom Checker**: Predict potential diseases in cows by selecting symptoms from a comprehensive list.
- **Voting Classifier**: Utilizes a voting classifier that combines multiple machine learning algorithms RandomForest,Decision_Tree and GradientBoost algorithms for improved accuracy.

### Dog Disease Diagnosis
- **Skin Disease Diagnosis**: Upload images of dogs to diagnose skin diseases using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
- **Random Forest Algorithm**: Predict dog diseases based on predefined symptoms using a Random Forest algorithm.

### RAG Model Integration
- **Question Answering**: Retrieve information from a PDF document based on user queries (using LangChain and OpenAI),PDF contains Symptoms,treatment and medications for dog,cats,cows and goats.

üõ†Ô∏è Usage
Cow Disease Prediction
Navigate to the cow symptom checker page.
Select symptoms your cow is exhibiting.
Submit the form to receive a predicted disease based on the selected symptoms using a voting classifier.
Dog Skin Disease Diagnosis
Go to the dog image upload page.
Upload an image of your dog.
Submit the image to receive a diagnosis from the trained CNN model.
Dog Disease Prediction Using Random Forest
Navigate to the dog disease checker page.
Select predefined symptoms exhibited by your dog.
Submit the form to receive a predicted disease based on the selected symptoms using a Random Forest algorithm.
RAG Model Query
Access the chat page.
Enter your question related to the content of the PDF document.
Receive an answer generated by the RAG model.
